# Purchasing Data Analysis  

## Overview  
This project provides an in-depth analysis of purchasing data from 2023 to 2024. The analysis aims to:  
1. Identify class-A items using the Pareto principle (80/20 rule).  
2. Calculate safety stock and reorder points (ROP) for these items.  
3. Visualize purchasing trends over time for better decision-making.  

The project demonstrates the use of Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, showcasing skills in data manipulation, trend analysis, and optimization.  

## Features  
- **Class-A Item Identification**: Focus on high-priority items contributing most to purchasing activities.  
- **ROP Calculation**: Provide accurate reorder points using safety stock and demand forecasting.  
- **Purchasing Trend Visualization**: Line plots and charts to highlight monthly and yearly trends.  

## Tools & Libraries  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and aggregation.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for coding and documentation.  

## File Structure  
- `purchasing-analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.  
- `data/`: Contains the purchasing data files (not uploaded for confidentiality).  
- `output/`: Includes exported files like summary CSVs.  

## Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/purchasing-data-analysis.git

2. Install required libraries:  
   ```bash  
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   
3. Open the notebook and run the cells to reproduce the analysis:  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook purchasing-analysis.ipynb
